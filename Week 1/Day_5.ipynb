      "With more than 2000 years of history, Zaragoza is known for its colossal Basilica del Pilar, its Roman foundation, its cultural diversity and the approachability of its people.\n",
      "But its visitors have discovered much more among its streets. Zaragoza has two majestic cathedrals, a fortified Islamic palace in the city centre, monumental remains of the Roman Caesar Augusta, Renaissance-style palace houses, unique treasures of the work of Francisco de Goya, emblems of modern architecture and one of the most diverse gastronomic scenes in Spain.\n",
      "A crossroads\n",
      "Zaragoza, capital of Aragon, is the fifth Spanish city in number of inhabitants. Located at a crossroads between other large Spanish cities, the capital of the Ebro is an ideal destination for a city break. Its international airport, its high-speed train station and its radial road network place it 2/3 hours from the main destinations in the north and centre of Spain, as well as the south of France.\n",
      "A destination of surprises\n",
      "It's easy to feel at home in Zaragoza. The approachability of its people, the accessibility of its spaces and the freshness of its blue skies are the best setting for a city endowed with a rich heritage, characterised by its cultural diversity.\n",
      "Zaragoza also has a monumental and pedestrianised old quarter, large green spaces with a unique character, kilometres of cycle lanes, sustainable urban transport, a wide variety of squares, viewpoints, terraces, corners, surprises, palaces, museums and churches. And the warm social atmosphere of its streets, the gastronomic variety of its restaurants, its tapas and its nightlife.\n",
      "And a monumental city\n",
      "Zaragoza is a monumental historical heritage site. The heritage of its four ancestral cultures flourishes in its streets. Its main attraction, the Basilica of Nuestra Señora del Pilar, is the symbol of the city and Zaragoza's second cathedral. Inside, you can find beautiful works by Francisco de Goya and the revered carving of the Virgen del Pilar. An essential part of a visit to the Basilica is the climb to the lookout tower of San Francisco de Borja.\n",
      "A few steps away is the Cathedral of El Salvador, the city's main historic temple and a leading example of Aragonese Mudéjar art, awarded the World Heritage designation by the UNESCO. Inside, it also houses one of the best collections of Flemish tapestries from the 15th-17th centuries.\n",

      "Saraqusta\n",
      ". The palace, whose Mudéjar art was declared a World Heritage site in 2001, continues to surprise its visitors with the unexpected beauty of its Arabic style so far north into Spain.\n",

When you visit us you will be enchanted with the stories behind every work of art and remember them forever.\n",

Here you\\'ll find traditional family-run, century-old bars where friends meet up for a drink, every style of neighbourhood and cultural centres that offer up an alternative type of tourism. Madrid\\'s authenticity is hard to beat. It is\\nwelcoming and diverse\\n. Madrid is, without a doubt, one of Europe’s most interesting cities.\\nCulture and leisure at any time\\nAnyone in search of culture attractions will find some of the most important museums in the world, such as the\\nPrado\\n, Reina Sofía or Thyssen museums. But we must not forget smaller options, full of charm, such as the Sorolla Museum or cultural centres like the\\nMatadero\\nor Conde Duque, which are continuously offering innovative exhibitions, concerts, guided tours, etc.\\nWalking around Madrid means coming across\\niconic spots\\nsuch as the stunning Royal Palace, the Plaza Mayor with 400 years of history, the buzzing Puerta del Sol, the famous Gran Vía full of shops, or the four tallest towers in Spain. Each neighbourhood offers a different experience:\\nLa Latina\\nis ideal for tapas, Las Letras has the perfect combination of literature and fine dining… But Madrid also means relaxing in enormous\\ngreen spaces\\nsuch as the Retiro Park (which together with the Paseo del Prado boulevard have been added to UNESCO\\'s World Heritage List), and other lesser-known but equally charming parks like El Capricho.\\nCapital of food, fashion and nightlife\\nWhen it\\'s time to eat, Madrid has many different options, each more appealing than the last. On the one hand, traditional bars where you can discover exactly what\\ncastizo\\nmeans and why tapas are so much fun. On the other hand, there are its cutting-edge restaurants like DiverXO and traditional markets that have been turned into new gourmet spaces, such as San Miguel, which has become a true gastronomic shrine. In Madrid, the time is always ripe to enjoy an animated, urban atmosphere. For example, the increasingly famous weekend brunches in enclosed glass\\nterraces\\n, courtyards, rooftops, etc.\\nFashionistas\\nwill find all options: luxury shops on the Golden Mile, vintage establishments in areas such as Fuencarral, new designer markets like the Mercado de Motores, and craft workshops and bookshops over 100 years old. At dusk, some of the city’s\\nviewpoints\\nwill surprise you with unique sunsets, at the Temple of Debod or the rooftop bar of the Círculo de Bellas Artes, for example. And at the end of the day... nightlife in Madrid is legendary with live music, all kinds of ambiences, music until the sun comes up...\\nMadrid has its own beauty. Madrid stimulates and inspires.\\nMadrid.

This is\\nValencia\\n, one of Spain’s most welcoming cities to spend a few days. Beyond the cultural effervescence of its cities, a stroll is always a good idea, or bathing at its Mediterranean beaches. Of course, you must try the star dish, paella (true authenticity!) and other delicacies such as clams or tiger nut milk.\\nAny time is a good time to visit Valencia, although if there is one day that is even more special than the rest, it\\'s 19 March, when they celebrate the famous\\nFallas\\nby burning gigantic ‘cardboard sculptures’. Its Mediterranean light, mild climate and the bewitching fire make this a city you’ll want to stay in.\\nA cultural stroll: between the classic and the avant-garde\\nValencia is perfect to discover on foot One of the most fascinating attractions is the Plaza de la Reina, with the\\nCathedral\\nand the\\nMiguelete\\ntower, where you should climb the 207 steps for some beautiful views. In the city centre you can also find the\\nSilk Exchange\\n-one of Valencia’s most beautiful buildings, a World Heritage Site, with its idyllic Patio de los Naranjos courtyard full of orange trees- and the Modernist\\nCentral Market\\n– Europe’s largest fresh produce market, so taking in its stalls is a true experience. A few metres away is the\\nNational Ceramic Museum\\nwith its impressive façade or the\\nQuart and Serrano Towers\\n. And also museums such as the\\nIVAM\\nor many surprising spots full of street art.\\nA little further from the centre is the most modern face of Valencia: the\\nCity of Arts and Sciences\\n. Designed by Santiago Calatrava and Félix Candela, it has fought to become a landmark with buildings such as the Oceanogràfic, Europe’s largest aquarium. Its original shapes make the ideal backdrop for taking a photo.\\nA paella by the sea\\nThere is no better plan than visiting one of the large beaches and having a\\npaella by the sea\\n. Valencia offers\\nover 300 days of sun a year\\n. The\\nMalvarrosa beach\\nis one of the most well-known options. Once there, the fine golden sand and blue water remind you of the famous paintings in which Sorolla would depict the city. How could you resist a dip in the sea?\\nThose looking for ‘wilder’ landscapes can visit El Saler, or El Palmar and try its famous paella. You can end the day taking in the\\nsunset at the\\nla Albufera\\n, a navigable lake next to the sea known as the “mirror of the sun”, where you can see the best sunsets on the Mediterranean.\\nThe beach is not the city’s only outdoor plan, you can also take a walk along the huge\\nTuria city garden\\nor a family visit to the\\nBioparc\\nzoo.\\nWhen the evening comes, there is nothing better than sitting at a terrace or an innovative restaurant, perhaps with a Michelin Star, and enjoying the buzzing nightlife atmosphere of El Carmen, or new fashionable areas for foodies such as\\nRuzafa\\n.\\nRead more\\nClose\\nShare\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nE-mail\\nDownload offline\\nSave favourite\\nRemove favourite\\nGo to my favourites\\nDebe activar Javascript para poder utilizar este servicio\\nUseful links\\nVisit Valencia\\nValencia tourist map\\nValencia transport maps\\nAccessible destination\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nActiva JS\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nScience Museum\\nValencia Cathedral\\nCity of Arts and Sciences\\nThe Silk Exchange\\nValencia Institute of Modern Art (IVAM)\\nValencia Regional Government Palace\\nEl Miguelete Tower\\nPalau de la Música auditorium\\nBioparc Valencia\\nWhat to do\\nOther\\nideas for your trip\\nThe Silk Route in Valencia\\nThe silk route reveals the importance of silk and its trade to Valencia.

It might be because of the grandeur of its monuments. Or perhaps the charm of areas such as Triana.\\nIt may possibly be the scent of jasmine in its squares or the Spanish guitar music of its streets. Some say that it’s the tradition of its festivals, and many are convinced its tapas are the real reason.\\nA monumental city\\nYou can see it for yourself in the few metres that separate the Giralda tower, the Cathedral and the Real Alcázar of Seville.\\nLa Giralda\\nis a city icon and one of its main charms lies in its viewpoint. The views of Seville are fantastic with its courtyards of orange trees, typical in Andalusia, and a close-up of the largest Gothic temple in Europe, the\\nCathedral\\n. A visit to the\\nReal Alcázar\\nreveals an extraordinary palace ensemble packed with details. If you visit in the summer, take advantage of the night visits and the festival held in its gardens.\\nSeville is much more than its undeniable monumentality. It is a city of lively streets and\\nlarge open spaces\\nsuch as the huge\\nPlaza de España\\n,\\nMaría Luisa Park\\n, and the avant-garde\\nSetas de Sevilla\\n. And if you want to enjoy the authentic\\natmosphere of Seville\\n, try\\ngoing for tapas in the old town\\n, in popular areas such as Alameda, Macarena, Nervión, Los Remedios or Triana. Marinated ‘pescaíto’ (fish), small filled rolls, typical snails, fino (white wine), manzanilla (sweet wine) or a cold beer are a must on any tapas outing.\\nPopular tradition of the south\\nIn Seville,\\ntradition\\nis always\\nin fashion\\n. From\\nflamenco shows\\nand\\nSpanish guitar\\nmusic to\\ntypical ceramics and crafts\\n, which are always a good souvenir of the city. There are plenty of shops and workshops in Triana. And it’s easy to enjoy flamenco at one of the many ‘tablao’ or neighbourhood ‘peña’ groups. In fact, Seville hosts what is perhaps the most important international festival of this art:\\nthe Bienal\\n.\\nThe tradition of Seville is also reflected in its more international\\nfestivals\\n. Two good examples are the\\nApril Fair\\nand the\\nEaster Week\\n. The first is all about joy and passion for popular Andalusian art, an unbeatable chance to enjoy the sound of the Spanish guitar, flamenco fashion and festive Seville.\\nHoly Week\\nis a passionate festival full of emotional moments. To understand it, the best option is to witness one of the much-visited religious processions or hear a live ‘saeta’ (emotional flamenco song dedicated to the religious figures).\\nRead more\\nClose\\nShare\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nE-mail\\nDownload offline\\nSave favourite\\nRemove favourite\\nGo to my favourites\\nDebe activar Javascript para poder utilizar este servicio\\nUseful links\\nSeville Tourism\\nDownload tourist map\\nDownload tourist map of Triana\\nDownload opening times and prices of main sights\\nAccessible destination\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nActiva JS\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nMaría Luisa park\\nCasa Murillo\\nGeneral Archive of the Indies\\nSanta Cruz quarter\\nPlaza América\\nCasa de Pilatos\\nSeville Town Hall\\nThe Torre del Oro tower\\nLa Giralda tower\\nReal Alcázar Palace of Seville\\nWhat to do\\nOther\\nideas for your trip\\nThe Vía de la Plata (Silver Route)\\nFrom Seville to Gijón, going through heritage cities like Mérida, Salamanca, León and Astorga.…\\nRead more\\nTrips to discover the real Seville\\nSeville is a lively city, with lots of atmosphere in its streets and with very popular places that reveal the most traditional Andalusia.…\\nRead more\\nTwo-day tours of Seville\\nSeville is world-famous for its Easter ceremonies and the Feria de Abril (April Fair).

Zaragoza has two majestic cathedrals, a fortified Islamic palace in the city centre, monumental remains of the Roman Caesar Augusta, Renaissance-style palace houses, unique treasures of the work of Francisco de Goya, emblems of modern architecture and one of the most diverse gastronomic scenes in Spain.\\nA crossroads\\nZaragoza, capital of Aragon, is the fifth Spanish city in number of inhabitants. Located at a crossroads between other large Spanish cities, the capital of the Ebro is an ideal destination for a city break. Its international airport, its high-speed train station and its radial road network place it 2/3 hours from the main destinations in the north and centre of Spain, as well as the south of France.\\nA destination of surprises\\nIt\\'s easy to feel at home in Zaragoza. The approachability of its people, the accessibility of its spaces and the freshness of its blue skies are the best setting for a city endowed with a rich heritage, characterised by its cultural diversity.\\nZaragoza also has a monumental and pedestrianised old quarter, large green spaces with a unique character, kilometres of cycle lanes, sustainable urban transport, a wide variety of squares, viewpoints, terraces, corners, surprises, palaces, museums and churches. And the warm social atmosphere of its streets, the gastronomic variety of its restaurants, its tapas and its nightlife.\\nAnd a monumental city\\nZaragoza is a monumental historical heritage site. The heritage of its four ancestral cultures flourishes in its streets. Its main attraction, the Basilica of Nuestra Señora del Pilar, is the symbol of the city and Zaragoza\\'s second cathedral. Inside, you can find beautiful works by Francisco de Goya and the revered carving of the Virgen del Pilar. An essential part of a visit to the Basilica is the climb to the lookout tower of San Francisco de Borja.\\nA few steps away is the Cathedral of El Salvador, the city\\'s main historic temple and a leading example of Aragonese Mudéjar art, awarded the World Heritage designation by the UNESCO. Inside, it also houses one of the best collections of Flemish tapestries from the 15th-17th centuries.\\nAlso essential is the beautiful Aljafería Palace, an 11th-century Islamic fortress, built as a pleasure palace for the kings of the taifa of\\nSaraqusta\\n. The palace, whose Mudéjar art was declared a World Heritage site in 2001, continues to surprise its visitors with the unexpected beauty of its Arabic style so far north into Spain.\\nThe best way to discover the monumental Zaragoza is through its guided tours or on board its tourist bus, whose route brings you closer to the city\\'s main attractions and its large green spaces: the Grande Jose Antonio Labordeta park and the\\nLuis Buñuel water park\\n.\\nRead more\\nClose\\nShare\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nE-mail\\nDownload offline\\nSave favourite\\nRemove favourite\\nGo to my favourites\\nDebe activar Javascript para poder utilizar este servicio\\nUseful links\\nZaragoza Turismo\\nDownload tourist map\\nGuided tours\\nAccessible destination\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nActiva JS\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nThird Millennium Bridge\\nAljafería Palace\\nChurch of San Pablo in Zaragoza\\nLonja de Zaragoza\\nBasilica of Santa Engracia\\nAragonese Institute of Contemporary Art and Culture (IAACC) Pablo Serrano\\nLa Seo or Cathedral of San Salvador\\nCaesaraugusta Forum Museum\\nNuestra Señora del Pilar Basilica\\nZaragoza aquarium\\nWhat to do\\nOther\\nideas for your trip\\nCuisine ideas in Zaragoza\\nDid you know that Zaragoza offers guided tours aimed at tickling the taste buds for you to enjoy during your visit?…\\nRead more\\nFun for all the family in Aragon\\nThe Aragon region stands out for the variety of its environments.

And the birthplace of Pablo Picasso has reinvented itself in recent year, inaugurating museums for all tastes.\\nIf we take the combination of culture and the sea and add a lively atmosphere, numerous tapas served in bars, cutting-edge neighbourhoods like Soho, areas like the port that have transformed and become more modern and monuments with centuries of history, the result is a city full of passion that anyone would want to explore. Because if everyone says that Malaga is prettier than ever then it must be true.\\nA journey in time\\nMalaga is a city full of historic spots, like the\\nAlcazaba\\n, one of the largest Arab fortresses in Andalusia, or\\nGibralfaro Castle\\n, which offers the best views over the whole city. At the foot of the castle there is a\\nRoman theatre\\nand an old town to stroll around. As you walk through its streets you\\'ll find spots like the\\nAtarazanas Market\\n, where you can try a vermouth, and monuments like the\\nCathedral\\n, which is known as “The One-Armed” (la manquita) due to its unfinished south tower. You can’t miss visiting its roof; a unique experience. Here in the city of\\nPicasso\\n, you can visit the excellent Picasso Museum in the centre, and the\\nhome where he was born\\n.\\nBut Malaga doesn’t only live on its past. In recent years it has inaugurated the\\nCarmen Thyssen Museum\\n, the only\\nPompidou Centre\\noutside France -its coloured cubes have become an icon- or the\\nSaint Petersburg Russian Museum Collection.\\nAnd if you prefer a more underground culture, look out for the\\nCentre for Contemporary Art\\n, the street art on the city’s buildings, and the alternative establishments in the Soho neighbourhood.\\nEssence of Malaga\\nSeveral things make Malaga a unique place. To start, beyond its monuments, a sunny day spent on the legendary\\nLa Malagueta urban beach\\nis a must. Anyone who wants to delve into traditional flavours should visit the seaside neighbourhood of\\nPedregalejo\\nand try the typical grilled sardines on\\nskewers\\n.\\nBack to La Malagueta, nearby you can find\\nMuelle 1\\n, a port promenade full of shops and restaurants that is perfect for a sunset stroll to\\nLa Farola\\n, a lighthouse that is a symbol of the city.\\nAnother emblem of Malaga? Without a doubt its\\npedestrian street Marqués de Larios\\n, a busy thoroughfare decorated with flowers and which you must visit at least once on a trip to Malaga. At night, this area and its nearby streets become the perfect spot for tapas at establishments that have become an institution, such as\\nBodega El Pimpi\\n; and for trying the ajoblanco chilled garlic soup.\\nMalaga is also known for its\\nFilm Festival\\n, its\\nHoly Week\\n, its innovative restaurants... But above all, Malaga is joy. And it\\'s catching.\\nRead more\\nClose\\nShare\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nE-mail\\nDownload offline\\nSave favourite\\nRemove favourite\\nGo to my favourites\\nDebe activar Javascript para poder utilizar este servicio\\nUseful links\\nMálaga Turismo\\nDownload map of Malaga\\nAccessible destination\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nActiva JS\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nSoho Málaga - the Art District\\nCollection of the Russian Museum in Malaga\\nAlameda/Malaga Park\\nPompidou Centre Malaga\\nCarmen Thyssen Museum in Malaga\\nPicasso Museum Malaga\\nMalaga Cathedral\\nMálaga Roman Theatre\\nAlcazaba fortress in Malaga\\nWhat to do\\nOther\\nideas for your trip\\nMalaga, cosmopolitan and hip\\nSeveral things make Malaga one of the most important Spanish cities for culture.…\\nRead more\\n©\\nTurismo de Málaga\\nThings to do in Malaga From urban art to sardine skewers\\nThe capital of Costa del Sol is famous for its nice weather and beautiful beaches. but there is much more to it than that.

In fact, to this day it is making an impact due to its groundbreaking structures created by prestigious architects, and it serves as an international reference point for modernity.\\nAlthough, curiously, its unique character comes from combining avant-garde with the traditional feel of its old town, full of charming streets and bars offering pintxos, proof that they are passionate about gastronomy around here. All this has earned Bilbao a place of honour on the lists of Spain’s most interesting cities.\\nA walk full of contrasts\\nA visit to this city in the north of Spain could start with the\\nGuggenheim Museum\\n. It is one of the most surprising examples of 20th century architecture as Frank Gehry used 33,000 ultra-thin titanium plates to create its curious curves. Inside, it shares the world’s most important private collection of modern and contemporary art with New York and Venice. Also, Bilbao has another of the best art galleries in Spain: the\\nMuseum of Fine Arts\\n.\\nThe city’s commitment to creating a ground-breaking, imaginative image also includes the\\nEuskalduna Conference Centre\\n,\\nNorman Foster’s\\nmetro stations, the\\nIsozaki and Pelli\\ntowers, the Zubizuri bridge designed by\\nCalatrava\\nor new cultural centres such as La Alhóndiga by\\nPhilippe Starck\\n, built over an old wine cellar.\\nOn the other hand, it’s impossible to imagine Bilbao without its characteristic\\nold town\\n, with over 700 years of history. It’s a pleasure to stroll around the famous “Seven Streets” and discover iconic buildings such as the Cathedral or the elegant theatre inspired by the Paris Opera House, the\\nArriaga\\n, and a mix of shops and cafes, from traditional to cool.\\nTwo strengths: Basque cuisine and a green city\\nThe city of Bilbao is proof that\\ngastronomy is an art\\nin the Basque Country – one of the areas with the most Michelin Stars per person in the world. Plaza Nueva and its surrounding streets are full of busy bars serving their famous pinchos: small, delicious bites of food. Here, foodies can find their place among the buzzing bars, family-run restaurants and prestigious chefs. And they will also have the chance to visit the\\nLa Ribera Market\\n, a beautiful building where you can have the produce that you purchase cooked for you, or where you can sample as selection of\\npintxos\\nand\\nTxakoli\\nwine to the beat of live music.\\nCultural and culinary Bilbao is also a green city, with\\nparks\\nsuch as Doña Casilda de Iturrizar, surrounded by hills (dare to ride the Artxanda cable car, a classic option to get a bird’s eye view of Bilbao). The\\nestuary\\nis another symbol of the regeneration of Bilbao. You can spot people paddle surfing on the water, or take a boat to the famous\\nHanging Bridge\\nof Portugalete, declared a World Heritage Site.\\nAnd if that’s not enough, the\\nbeaches\\nand stunning cliffs of\\nGetxo\\nare just over 30 minutes away on the metro.\\nRead more\\nClose\\nShare\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nE-mail\\nDownload offline\\nSave favourite\\nRemove favourite\\nGo to my favourites\\nDebe activar Javascript para poder utilizar este servicio\\nUseful links\\nBilbao Tourism\\nTourist map\\nTourist guide\\nGuided tours\\nAccessible destination\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nActiva JS\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nPlaza Nueva square\\nGuggenheim Museum Bilbao\\nBilbao Museum of Fine Arts\\nBegoña Basilica\\nDeusto University\\nRegional Government Building\\nSantiago Cathedral\\nBilbao Town Hall\\nArriaga Theatre\\nLa Ribera Market\\nWhat to do\\nOther\\nideas for your trip\\nImages of modern architecture in Bilbao\\nFrank Gehry’s Guggenheim Museum Bilbao started a contemporary architecture movement which transformed the image of Bilbao to make it an emblem of creativity and…\\nRead more\\nBilbao, pincho by pincho\\nTaste and creativity in equal measure in one, or at most two, bites.

According to tradition, this is the burial place of the relics of James the Apostle, discovered in the 9th century.\\nHowever, Santiago de Compostela is a very lively city with many other reasons to delight the traveller, whether a pilgrim or not: countless restaurants and bars where you can savour the region\\'s exquisite seafood, a historic quarter declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, contemporary art offerings, etc. There is lots to do in this city that combines history with a younger, more modern face.\\nLife around the Cathedral\\nPerhaps the most special place in Santiago is Plaza del Obradoiro. Life in the city seems to revolve around this point, the site of the\\nCathedral\\n,\\nRaxoi Palace\\n, and the luxurious\\nHostal de los Reyes Católicos\\n, said to be the world’s oldest hotel. On this square you’re likely to see\\npilgrims\\nwith their inevitable walking sticks and scallop shells. Then comes the ritual to get to know the Cathedral: Contemplate the Portico of Glory, hug the figure of Santiago on the High Altar, go down to the crypt, go up to the roofs (what a view!) and, if you\\'re lucky, see the botafumeiro (a huge censer) in operation, as it only swings on some holidays or upon prior request.\\nAround the Cathedral, every step is a discovery, with other very charming\\nsquares\\nsuch as\\nPraterías\\n(with the best view of the bell tower, La Berenguela) or\\nQuintana\\nwith its pretty stairs and other monuments like the imposing\\nMonastery of San Martiño Pinario\\n.\\nIt’s curious that even the far outskirts of the city seem as if they were designed for admiring the Cathedral. An example is the quiet\\nAlameda Park\\nand the viewing point of Monte do Gozo, with sculptures of pilgrims which have starred in so many photographs.\\nFine dining and the modern city\\nTo be tempted by delicious smells and tastes, and see why Galicia’s food is so famous, there’s nothing like a visit to the\\nMercado de Abastos\\nfood market, the second most visited place in the city. Here you can buy and taste seafood fresh from the rías, cheeses and Padrón peppers, or try the famous tapas. You can also feel the real atmosphere of Santiago on\\nCalle Franco and Calle Raiña\\n, in the heart of the old town, where locals and visitors have been enjoying tapas “since forever” and where you will find plenty of restaurants for trying\\noctopus “a feira”\\n, scallops,\\nSantiago cake\\nor wines like\\nAlbariño\\n, considered one of the world’s best white wines.\\nBeyond the narrow streets and stone houses and palaces, the more modern side of Santiago can be seen in its university atmosphere, in its art galleries and above all in two places: the\\nGalician Centre of Contemporary Art\\nand the\\nCidade da Cultura\\n, the work of New Yorker Peter Eisenman and one of the most surprising examples of contemporary Galician architecture.\\nMany people say that taking the Way and arriving in Santiago is an adventure that can change your life. This city certainly seems capable of keeping you here.\\nRead more\\nClose\\nShare\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nE-mail\\nDownload offline\\nSave favourite\\nRemove favourite\\nGo to my favourites\\nDebe activar Javascript para poder utilizar este servicio\\nUseful links\\nSantiago de Compostela Tourist Office\\nCity map\\nCathedral leaflet\\nAccessible destination\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nActiva JS\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nSan Lorenzo de Trasouto\\nGalician Centre of Contemporary Art (CGAC)\\nMuseum of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela\\nHostal de los Reyes Católicos\\nSantiago de Compostela Cathedral\\nRaxoi Palace\\nCasa do Cabildo house\\nMuseum of Galician People\\nCidade da Cultura\\nWhat to do\\nOther\\nideas for your trip\\nA day of culture in Santiago de Compostela\\nThousands of people flock to Santiago de Compostela with a single desire: to discover the Cathedral, the end point of the Camino de Santiago.…\\nRead more\\n©\\nTurismo de Santiago\\nFrench Route\\nFrom the Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela, the French Way passes through the regions of Aragón, Navarre, La Rioja, Castile and Leon, and Galicia on a route…\\nRead more\\nSpain’s most popular stops along The Way of Saint James\\nAmong the many routes of The Way of Saint James, there’s one which lets you discover the north of Spain in a different way.…\\nRead more\\nSantiago de Compostela, destination for a couple’s getaway\\nSantiago de Compostela, in the region of Galicia (northern Spain) is well-known for the lively atmosphere of its pretty cobbled streets, full of pilgrims and…\\nRead more\\nDiscovering the unknown heritage of Galicia\\nGalicia is usually associated with monumental sites like Santiago de Compostela Cathedral or the Tower of Hercules, and beaches like Las Catedrales.…\\nRead more\\n©\\nJuantiagues\\nFrench Route\\nFrom the Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela, the French Way…\\nSpain’s most popular stops along The Way of Saint James\\nAmong the many routes of The Way of Saint James, there’s one…\\nSantiago de Compostela, destination for a couple’s getaway\\nSantiago de Compostela, in the region of Galicia (northern Spain)…\\nDiscovering the unknown heritage of Galicia\\nGalicia is usually associated with monumental sites like Santiago…\\nA day of culture in Santiago de Compostela\\nThousands of people flock to Santiago de Compostela with a single…\\nPractical information\\nHow to get there - transport information\\nSelect the means of transport to see how to get there or how to get around at your destination.\\nHow to get to\\xa0aeroplane\\nSantiago Airport\\nis 10 kilometres outside the city.\\nThere are taxis and bus services between the airport and the city.

Taking a walk through the streets of its historical centre, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, means taking a walk through centuries of history, art and knowledge and experiencing the wonder of landmarks such as its famous University, one of the oldest in Europe, and which today continues to attract thousands of students.\\nWhen evening comes, the light of the setting sun gives the monuments a special golden hue, thanks to the stone from which they are built. It is then that the night-time Salamanca comes into its own, bringing a lively, youthful atmosphere.\\nSecrets hidden in monuments.\\nWhen you enter the monuments of Salamanca, a world of legends and history awaits you. A good stroll could start in its famous\\nPlaza Mayor\\n, the meeting point par excellence in the city. Enjoying a coffee in the legendary Novelty while looking at its 88 arches or sitting quietly on any of its terraces are all highly recommended.\\nYou can start exploring at the two\\ncathedrals\\nin Salamanca (yes, two!, the New and the Old). On the Puerta de Ramos of the New Cathedral, you need to find the figure of an astronaut carved from stone and then go up one of its towers on the\\nleronimus\\ntour, to experience unbeatable views.\\nMore secrets? The\\nUniversity\\nof Salamanca features a stone frog “hidden” in the façade which is said to bring luck to students; legend has it that the palace of\\nCasa de las Conchas\\nhides a treasure, the\\nhuerto de Calixto y Melibea\\n, which is really a garden linked to a literary tale; it is said that the Devil taught witchcraft in the\\nSalamanca Cave\\n... And there are thousands more stories like these in a city that has so many landmarks to discover, such as the\\nCasa Lis\\n, the Cielo de Salamanca, the Clerecía, the Roman bridge...\\nCuisine and nightlife: two more of Salamanca\\'s strong points\\nOne thing that is certainly no secret is the fantastic cuisine in the city. Some of its typical products include the various\\ncured sausages\\n,\\nham from Guijuelo\\n, and the popular snack known as \\'hornazo\\', a pastry filled with egg and other ingredients such as pork loin, chorizo… You can purchase some to take away with you, although eating it here definitely makes it taste all the more delicious.\\nSpeaking of\\nshopping\\n, the pedestrianised\\nstreets of Toro and Zamora\\nare full of shops and in the Plaza del Liceo you can even go shopping in a refurbished church, part of the old convent of San Antonio el Real.\\nThe city\\'s nightlife also has a well-earned reputation as university students bring life to the city both day and night. Their vitality can be felt on a\\ntapas\\ntour along\\nCalle Van Dyck\\nand their alternative culture is also present in the\\nBarrio del Oeste\\nneighbourhood, where you find garages and walls covered in\\nurban art\\n. Under the moonlight, the monuments are lit up and it\\'s time for live concerts or a drink in any of the city\\'s bars.\\nRead more\\nClose\\nShare\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nE-mail\\nDownload offline\\nSave favourite\\nRemove favourite\\nGo to my favourites\\nDebe activar Javascript para poder utilizar este servicio\\nUseful links\\nSalamanca Tourist Board\\nDownload map of Salamanca\\nLeaflets on Salamanca\\nGuided tours\\nAudio guides\\nAccessible destination\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nActiva JS\\nDon’t miss it\\nWhat to visit\\nSelect from the list or hover over the map to find out about points of interest.\\nDomus Artium 2002\\nCasa Lis Art Nouveau and Art Deco Museum\\nLas Dueñas Convent\\nArchbishop Fonseca College\\nCasa de las Conchas house\\nSalamanca Plaza Mayor Square\\nLa Clerecía Building\\nSalamanca University\\nSalamanca Cathedral\\nWhat to do\\nOther\\nideas for your trip\\nThe Vía de la Plata (Silver Route)\\nFrom Seville to Gijón, going through heritage cities like Mérida, Salamanca, León and Astorga.…\\nRead more\\nOne day in Salamanca\\nIf you want to get to know one of the most beautiful World Heritage Cities in Spain, why not arrange a day out in Salamanca?…\\nRead more\\nUnusual places and routes in Salamanca\\nStreet art, legendary places, unknown spaces, spectacular towers… The city of Salamanca has plenty of unusual things to see and do for those who want a…\\nRead more\\n©\\nTurismo de Salamanca\\nRoute of the Spanish language\\nDiscovering the origins of Spanish by visiting the landmarks on the Route of the Spanish Language is an opportunity to explore the monumental beauty and…\\nRead more\\n©\\nGrupo Ciudades Patrimonio\\nOne day in Salamanca\\nIf you want to get to know one of the most beautiful World…\\nUnusual places and routes in Salamanca\\nStreet art, legendary places, unknown spaces, spectacular towers……\\nRoute of the Spanish language\\nDiscovering the origins of Spanish by visiting the landmarks on…\\nThe Vía de la Plata (Silver Route)\\nFrom Seville to Gijón, going through heritage cities like Mérida,…\\nPractical information\\nHow to get there - transport information\\nSelect the means of transport to see how to get there or how to get around at your destination.\\nHow to get there by\\xa0road\\nVia the A-62 and A-66 motorways.\\nFrom Madrid, take the A-50 motorway.\\nHow to get to\\xa0bus\\nFrom Terminals 1 and 4 of Madrid-Barajas Adolfo Suárez airport there is a line\\noperated by Avanza Bus\\n, which goes directly to Salamanca.

Surrounded by mansions, Renaissance palaces and churches crowned by storks’ nests, you’ll understand why Cáceres is a World Heritage City. Get your camera ready to immortalise one of the prettiest historic town centres of Spain.\\nLife around the Plaza Mayor\\nWe recommend that you enter the city through its traditional entrance: the 18th-century\\nEstrella Arch\\n, which is wide enough for carriages to drive through. Below you, you’ll see the wide\\nPlaza Mayor\\n, an arcaded square always full of life, with plenty of places to stop for a drink or a coffee.\\nIn past centuries, the square was also used for bullfights, and before that, for jousting. Take a moment to snap a photo with the\\nBujaco Tower\\nin the background. Next, a stroll around the old quarter reveals\\nmansions\\n:\\nGolfines de Abajo\\n,\\nCarvajal\\n,\\nToledo-Moctezuma\\n(home of the daughter of the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II),\\nCasa de las Veletas\\n(now the Museum of Cáceres, with works by Picasso and Miró, and the world’s second largest cistern well), and the\\nCo-cathedral of Santa María\\n, with amazing views from the belltower.\\nYou can also visit the contemporary art collection at the\\nFundación Helga de Alvear\\n, or walk around the Jewish quarter,\\nJudería Vieja\\nwith its narrow streets, whitewashed houses and windows full of flowers. A most pleasant experience.\\nAt the end of the day, the perfect place to take in the view of Cáceres is the\\nSantuario de la Montaña\\n, a shrine on the outskirts of the city. And in the evening, it’s fun to take a\\ndramatised tour\\nwith troubadours retelling legends by moonlight.\\nTraditional recipes and lots of culture\\nFor lunch or dinner, try traditional local dishes such as\\nmigas\\n(fried breadcrumbs with chorizo and bacon) accompanied by a wine from the Ribera del Guadiana Designation of Origin, or one of the increasingly popular artisan beers, with a\\ntorta del Casar\\n(one of the best cheeses in the world) or a potato sausage,\\nmorcilla patatera\\n. More sophisticated fare is available in the city’s most famous\\nrestaurant\\n,\\nAtrio\\n, which holds three Michelin stars. And if you want to try the famous convent pastries, the\\nsweets from the Convent of San Pablo\\nare very well-known.\\nCáceres also has an interesting cultural life. Depending on when you visit, you can go to the\\nWomad Festival\\n(in May), the\\nThree Cultures Medieval Market\\n(in November), the\\nClassical Theatre Festival\\n(in July) or traditional events such as\\nEaster\\n(in March or April. The city has a special Easter visitors’ centre).\\nHow to complete a perfect trip?

Citizens of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland may enter and travel within Spain with their national identity document or with their valid passport (unaccompanied minors travelling with an identity document must travel with a document certifying their parent or guardian\\'s permission).\\nTourists of\\ncertain nationalities\\nrequire a valid\\nvisit visa\\ncurrently in force. The visit visa will not be necessary if the traveller has a residence permit or a long-stay visa issued by a Schengen State.\\nThe authorities may also request that the reason for the trip be indicated and justified with documentation such as a booking for an organised trip, proof that the place of accommodation is real, or a letter of invitation.\\nIn all cases, the tourist must be able to prove the availability of economic resources for the planned stay in Spain and the return or transfer to another country.\\nThe maximum stay in Spain as a tourist is 90 days.\\nYou can consult more information and exceptions on the\\nwebsite of the Ministry of Interior\\n.\\nSince conditions may vary, we suggest that you contact the Spanish Embassy or Consulate to verify these requirements before you start your trip.\\nTypes of visas and where to get them\\nShort-stay visas: This is the general visa for tourists who are nationals of countries outside the\\nSchengen Area\\n, enabling them to stay and travel in Spain for 90 days. They are issued by the\\nembassies or consulates of Spain\\nin the country of origin. Visas issued by any member of the Schengen Area are also valid.\\nLong-stay visas: Required for any foreigner who wants to remain in Spain for more than 90 days, except for citizens of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland.\\nThere is also a visa for international teleworkers who meet certain requirements and an airport transit visa required for certain countries.\\nVisa for international teleworkers (digital nomads)\\nIt grants residence for international teleworking for a maximum period of one year anywhere in Spain. \\xa0Non-EU citizens can apply for it to carry out work-related activity remotely, exclusively online, for companies located outside of Spain. In the case of self-employed professionals, their telework for companies based in Spain cannot exceed the limit of 20% of their total work-related activity.\\nThe specific requirements to be eligible for this visa are: actual, continuous activity for at least one year for the company or companies for which the individual works; documentary proof that the work can be performed remotely; and an employment or professional relationship in place for at least the last three months preceding the application. Applicants must be qualified professionals who are graduates or postgraduates from universities, reputed vocational training and business schools or have a minimum of three years of professional experience.\\nWhen the teleworker is outside of Spain, they must apply for a visa through the\\nSpanish embassies or consulates\\n. If they wish to continue residing in Spain after the visa has expired and they still meet the requirements, they can apply for a residence permit for international remote workers from the\\nLarge Business and Strategic Groups Unit (UGE-CE)\\n, within 60 calendar days before it expires. This permit is valid for a maximum of three years and can be renewed every two years.\\nIf the teleworker is legally in Spain (on a tourist visa, for example) they can apply directly for a residence permit for three years from the UGE-CE.\\nAll the advice\\nMoney\\nSecurity\\nHealth\\nLanguage\\nConnections\\nComplaints\\nCompanion animals\\nTimetables and public holidays\\nDriving\\nSailing\\nAll the advice\\nVisa and passport\\nCustoms\\nMoney\\nSecurity\\nHealth\\nLanguage\\nConnections\\nComplaints\\nCompanion animals\\nTimetables and public holidays\\nDriving\\nSailing\\nAccessible mode\\nSpain\\nAll rights reserved\\nContact\\nAbout us\\nSite map\\nLegal notice\\nUse of the information\\nCookie Policy\\nAccessibility\\nYOUR NEW MEMORIES START HERE.\\nDISCOVER SPAIN WITH US\\nFOLLOW US ON…\\nYou are not online.
